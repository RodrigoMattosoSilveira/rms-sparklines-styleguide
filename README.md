# Description
This is a collection of web components to render [sparklines](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR), conceived by [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/). My motivation for this project is to use web component technology to implement sparklines. The project's overall concepts, but not source code, borrows extensively from [Gareth Watts](https://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/#s-about) jQery project.

These webcomponents are built using the [@nutmeg/cli](https://github.com/abraham/nutmeg-cli); this document assumes you are familiar with it and the ancillary technologies required by [@nutmeg/cli](https://github.com/abraham/nutmeg-cli).

### Source code
Check [rms-sparklines](https://github.com/RodrigoMattosoSilveira/rms-sparklines) for the web components repository.

Check [rms-sparklines-styleguide](https://github.com/RodrigoMattosoSilveira/rms-sparklines-styleguide) for this application's repository, an Angular web application illustrating their usage.
